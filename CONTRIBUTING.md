# Contributing

This project is open source, so contributors are welcome

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the git history in any way.
1. **No `rebase`**. I love my timeline messy.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.

### Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer(s).

### Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
